MyAbility was an idea that was formed through a NextGen Coders Network (NGCN) Project.

* NGCN brings together multidisciplinary university students and young professionals from Iraq, the Palestinian Territories, and the U.S. for a virtual exchange to learn coding and collaborate on a website or application that tackles a grand challenge.
