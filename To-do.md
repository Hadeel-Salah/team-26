### To-do List

- [ ] Add favicon


- [ ] Likely going to remove/reduce homepage animation(s) for less motion (TBD)


- [ ] Replace Animate-on-Scroll animations with raw CSS animations that run automatically?
> Or disable on mobile via ``` AOS.init({disable: 'mobile'}); ```


- [ ] Replace image placeholder on home page (stock image maybe?)
