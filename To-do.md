### To-do List
- [ ] Decide on overall "theme" of website (e.g playful, inspiring, formal)
> Playful I think?

- [ ] Likely going to remove/reduce a homepage animation for less motion (TBD)

- [ ] Replace Animate-on-Scroll animations with raw CSS animations that run automatically?
> Or disable on mobile via ``` AOS.init({disable: 'mobile'}); ```

- [ ] Replace image placeholder on home page (stock image maybe?)
