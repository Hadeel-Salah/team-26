### To-do List

General:
- [ ] Decide on additional pages
- [ ] Replace image placeholder on home page (stock image maybe?)

<br><br><br>

Future Fixes:
- [ ] Replace AOS with actual CSS animations
> (Because on some page loads, AOS animations get a little funky, likely do to the "scroll" aspect of it)
- [ ] Likely going to remove/reduce homepage animation(s) for less motion (TBD)
- [ ] Replace navlink animation maybe
> Likely change navlink hover to blue
