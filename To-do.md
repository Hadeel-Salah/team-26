### To-do List

General:
- [ ] Decide on additional pages
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Add meta descriptions
- [ ] Replace image placeholder on home page (stock image maybe?)
- [ ] **Need** to make AOS animations for hero section run auto. (Replace JS with CSS)

Future Fixes:
- [ ] Modifying animation timing possibly for user flow
- [ ] Likely going to remove/reduce homepage animation(s) for less motion (TBD)
- [ ] Replace navlink animation maybe
> Likely change navlink hover to blue
